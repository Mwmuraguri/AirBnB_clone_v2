# 0x04. AirBnB clone - Web framework
A web framework is a software framework designed to aid in the development of web applications, including websites, web services, and web APIs. Web frameworks provide a structured way to build web applications, offering tools and libraries for handling common web-related tasks, such as routing, request handling, database access, and templating. One popular web framework for Python is Flask.

Here's a brief overview of some of the topics you mentioned related to building a web framework with Flask:

How to build a web framework with Flask:
Flask is a micro web framework for Python. You can create a web application using Flask by following these steps:

Install Flask: You can install Flask using pip by running pip install Flask.
Create a Python script: Write your web application code in a Python script.
Define routes: Define the URL routes for your application.
Create templates: Create HTML templates for rendering dynamic content.
Set up a development server: Start a development server to test your application.
How to define routes in Flask:
In Flask, you define routes using the @app.route decorator. For example, to define a route for the root URL ("/"), you can use:
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello, World!'
What is a route:
A route is a URL pattern that maps to a specific function in your web application. When a user accesses a URL, the associated function (view function) is executed to generate the response.

How to handle variables in a route:
You can define dynamic routes by adding variable parts to the URL patterns in Flask. For example:
@app.route('/user/<username>')
def user_profile(username):
    return f'User Profile: {username}'
In this example, the username variable is extracted from the URL and passed as an argument to the view function.

What is a template:
A template is an HTML file that allows you to render dynamic content in your web application. Flask uses a templating engine like Jinja2 to insert dynamic data into HTML templates.

How to create an HTML response in Flask by using a template:
To render an HTML response using a template in Flask, you can use the render_template function:
from flask import render_template

@app.route('/user/<username>')
def user_profile(username):
    return render_template('profile.html', username=username)
